Version 3.0 8/5/02

Copyright (C) 2002   Faustino J. Gomez

This package contains the C++-code for evolving neural networks
to solve the double pole balancing problem.
See the file INSTALL for instructions on how to
install ESP; see USERDOC for instructions on how to run it; see FILES
for explanation on the software package itself. 

In case you don't know what ESP is, see e.g.
@TechReport{gomez:tr248,
  author       = "Faustino Gomez and Risto Miikkulainen",
  title	       = "Incremental Evolution of Complex General Behavior",
  institution  = UTCS,
  year	       = 1996,
  number       = "AI96-248",
  annote       = "Subsumed by the journal version \cite{gomez:ab97}",
}

or this for a more complete explanation of the pole balancing problem
that come with this package:

  author       = "Faustino Gomez and Risto Miikkulainen",
  title	       = "Solving Non-{M}arkovian Control Tasks with
                  Neuroevolution",
  booktitle    = IJCAI-99,
  year	       = 1999,
  address      = "Denver, CO",
  publisher    = KAUF,
